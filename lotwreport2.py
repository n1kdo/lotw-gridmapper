"""
lotwreport2.py: proxy for ARRL LoTW lotwreport.adi web service, which does not
support CORS headers and thus cannot be called from a script that is loaded
from any other server.  This CGI must be served from the same host name as
any script that wishes to call it.  Because I do not want other peoples'
scripts to call this service, it deliberately does not support CORS, either.
So don't try to call it on my server, it won't work.

Note: this is the obsolete Python 2 version.
